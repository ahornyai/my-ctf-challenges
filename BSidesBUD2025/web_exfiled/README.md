# ExfilEd
Welcome to ExfilEd, the next-gen educational platform where students submit assignments, and teachers review them in real time.

You’ve discovered that when a teacher views your submitted project link, their browser is logged in and has access to sensitive materials — like private test answers. You can’t directly read their data... but maybe you don’t have to.
